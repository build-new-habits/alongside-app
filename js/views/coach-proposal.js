/**
 * coach-proposal.js - Coach Proposal Screen
 *
 * v1.0 (S4-1, April 2026)
 *
 * The coach arrives with a plan. Not a menu. Not cards.
 * A single proposal in plain English, with visible reasoning,
 * and two responses: "Let's go" or "Something else."
 *
 * The coach reads:
 *   - Today's energy, mood, sleep from check-in
 *   - Last session from activityLog (type, when, how hard)
 *   - Active conditions and pain scores
 *   - Strategic goal and target date
 *   - Gym programme week and session
 *   - Available time
 *   - Days since last session
 *
 * From this it produces:
 *   - A named plan type (e.g. "gym session", "something quieter", "a walk")
 *   - A plain-English description of why
 *   - A duration estimate
 *   - A navigation target when accepted
 *
 * On "Something else": soft branching chips appear.
 *   - I had something in mind  → shows activity type chips
 *   - Suggest something different → revised proposal
 *   - Something shorter → same plan, shorter duration
 *   - Something quieter → navigates to quiet-session
 *
 * Header:
 *   ← Back          Library →
 *   (returns to     (goes to Library tab
 *    check-in)       in Settings)
 *
 * Route: coach-proposal
 * Nav: hidden (this IS the nav moment)

/**
 * Build a proposal object from all available store data.
 *
 * The coach speaks in four parts:
 *   1. Greeting     — time-aware, personal
 *   2. Reflection   — what you have done recently, drawn from activityLog (48h lookback, activity types)
 *   3. Constraint   — if applicable (pain, low energy), state it plainly
 *   4. Proposal     — "So I thought today..." — the actual suggestion
 *
 * Decision logic:
 *   1. Severe override (high pain ≥7) → disable "Let's go", explain why, offer adapted alternatives
 *   2. movementIdentity + activityPreferences weight the options
 *   3. Variety enforcement — avoid repeating yesterday's proposal type
 *   4. Energy-aware routing — low energy steers away from high-intensity
 *   5. Goal-aware routing — weight loss steers toward cardio variety
 *   6. Recent session analysis — avoid repeating same pattern 3+ days
 *   7. No unconditional defaults — gym is not assumed
 *
 * @param {boolean} preferShorter - build a shorter version of the same logic
 * @returns {{ greeting, reflection, constraint, proposal, rationale, duration, target, quietMode, severePainOverride, disabledOption }}

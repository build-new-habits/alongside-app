# Alongside: Move — Master Schedule
## 30 Jul 2026 v81

Build New Habits | Single source of truth for all build, business, website, and content tasks.
Supersedes `alongside_master_schedule_30jul2026_v80.md`. Remove v80 on upload.

**⚠️ Location:** the canonical copy of this document is `Documents/Admin/master_schedule.md` in the `alongside-app` repo, not project knowledge. If the repo and a project-knowledge copy ever disagree, the repo wins. This project-knowledge copy remains a searchable snapshot only. `Admin/Past MS/` in the repo holds every superseded version by date.

**This version's substantive changes:** Core Session `currentActivityEntry` data-integrity investigation — 🟢 **Closed.** Diagnosed as never having silently failed to log (core-session isn't reachable via `intention.js`'s activity list, but `logActivity()`'s fallback always fired with real data). A genuine id-reuse bug was found and fixed instead: `core-session.js` v3→v4. The same pattern was then confirmed and fixed in `yoga-session.js` v4→v5 as a same-session follow-up. `sw.js` v181→v183 across both fixes. See Core Session Outcome section below.

## ⭐ THIS WEEK — WB 27 Jul

- [x] ~~**Send solicitor pack to Alex**~~ — done, 24 Jul.
- [ ] **Safeguarding reviewer outreach** — still open.
- [ ] **HMRC sole trader registration** — untouched.
- [x] ~~**BUILD-5 fix session**~~ — 🟢 Closed, confirmed on-device 24 Jul. Three bugs, not one — see below.
- [ ] 🟡 **BUILD-3 on-device test pass** — code confirmed clean twice. Expected formality.
- [ ] **OUT-1 (reshaped) — Community validation reshaping session** — brief ready, not yet run.
- [ ] **Supabase account 2FA** — Graeme's own action, no session needed.
- [x] ~~**Thread scroll-bug audit**~~ — 🟢 **Done, 28 Jul.** Turned out to be mostly already resolved — see section below.
- [x] ~~**Meeting with Alex**~~ — 🟢 Held 29 Jul. Outcomes folded into v77 — see section below.
- [ ] **Friday: short review**.

## NEXT WEEK — WB 3 Aug

- [x] ~~**BUILD-4 (Schema Reconciliation)**~~ — 🟢 **Closed, 30 Jul, ahead of schedule.** `schema.md` v1.9 live in repo. See BUILD-4 Outcome section below.
- [x] ~~**Core Session `currentActivityEntry` data-integrity investigation**~~ — 🟢 **Closed, 30 Jul.** Never silently failing to log; genuine id-reuse bug found and fixed instead, in both `core-session.js` and (follow-up, same session) `yoga-session.js`. See Core Session Outcome section below.
- **Supabase schema design session** — now unblocked, BUILD-4 closed. Should factor in the BUILD-4 Appendix A follow-up (below) — worth deciding whether that follow-up runs first or alongside.
- **BUILD-4 Appendix A follow-up (new)** — ~18 fields found via grep during BUILD-4 but not individually triaged (`totalCredits`, `lastWorkoutName`/`lastWorkoutCredits`, `quietMode`, others). Same check-both-read-and-write method as the two corrections below. Recommended before Supabase schema design, not strictly blocking.
- BUILD-1's remaining sub-question
- BIZ-2, BIZ-3, INF-6, OUT-2, OUT-7
- **Org outreach category decision** (see Alex Meeting Outcomes below) — Graeme's call on whether workplace wellbeing reps and women's health groups join the Tier list, plus the "what's in it for them" messaging pass. Blocks OUT-2–OUT-8.

*Full six-week plan: Task Inventory doc, Section J (v5).*

## 🤝 Alex Meeting Outcomes — 29 Jul 2026

Captured in full in `alongside_alex_meeting_outcomes_29jul2026_v1.md`. Summary folded in here; that document remains the fuller record if detail is needed later.

**Legal — solicitor question refined.** Alex is reaching out to his solicitor contact with a specific framing: *"what's the minimum to be legally responsible?"* — with a working assumption that beta-stage requirements may be lighter than public-launch requirements. When the answer comes back, ask explicitly for the split rather than one combined answer. Relevant to BIZ-5, BIZ-6, BIZ-9 below.

**BIZ-9 (IP/trademark) — deprioritised.** Alex ran a logo unregistered for 20 years with no issue. Working position: don't worry about IP, especially the logo, not yet — if someone registers something similar first, the fallback is simply to change the logo. The product's actual IP (methodology, content, mechanics) is the genuinely distinct part, not the mark. Still worth a mention at the BIZ-5/6 solicitor consultation since it's a small add to an existing conversation, but no longer worth chasing separately.

**U18/safeguarding — genuinely open, not resolved.** Alex suggested "potentially we don't need to worry about U18." Graeme explained the safeguarding responsibility around collecting keywords from the mood meter; Alex understood the concern and will think on it and ask his solicitor. **This is not a decision — do not treat it as one.** Directly touches BUILD-9 (18+ age-gate), BIZ-6 (safeguarding sign-off), and the Crisis & Safeguarding Policy's own open item on parental notification (Section 9.4, unconfirmed as of v7). No schedule change until Alex/solicitor respond.

**Outreach — new categories suggested, plus a real gap surfaced.** Alex suggested workplaces with wellbeing reps, and women's health groups/communities, as additional outreach targets — he's thinking on this further too. He also raised the sharpest open question in the whole outreach effort: **"why would they do anything?"** — the current outreach messaging doesn't yet spell out the concrete benefit to the organisation itself. Two actions before any new-category outreach goes out: (1) Graeme's decision on whether these join the existing Tier list or run as a separate track, (2) a messaging pass answering "what's in it for them" per org type. This was already logged as "org outreach categories — undecided, blocks OUT-2–OUT-8" — still blocking, now with two named candidates and one clear open question instead of a vague undecided state.

**New task — LinkedIn presence.** Graeme wants a BNH business page and a personal profile, prompted by Alex's suggestion that LinkedIn plus direct email is a good channel for reaching both organisations and named individuals. Not yet scoped — Graeme has said he'll need help designing this properly. New item, no urgency attached yet, ready whenever Graeme wants to start.

**Deadlines — externally confirmed.** Alex agrees on two hard deadlines: **partner group/testing community + beta start, mid-September 2026**, and **public launch, January 2027** — the latter specifically because that's when people are most active in the "new year, new fitness" mindset, a named commercial rationale from Alex rather than just an internal target. This validates the dates already on this schedule; it doesn't resolve the underlying capacity risk (solo build/business load) flagged separately in Graeme's own meeting-prep review — both remain true at once.

## ✅ Core Session `currentActivityEntry` Data-Integrity Investigation: Closed, 30 Jul 2026

Full trace and reasoning in the session's own record (this PM chat, or `alongside_blueprint_coresession-integrity_30jul2026_v2.md` for the original brief). Summary:

**Diagnosis (code trace, no on-device pass yet — see below).** The blueprint's worry — that Core Session might never receive `currentActivityEntry` upstream and so might never have logged real completion data — was investigated by tracing every route into `core-session.js` (`library.js`, `home-threshold.js`, `today.js`, `coach-proposal.js` fallback options). **Confirmed: none of them set a pending entry.** Root structural reason: `intention.js`'s `ACTIVITIES` list doesn't include a "core" option at all — Core Session was never wired into that pattern. **But this was never actually blocking real data from being logged** — `finaliseSession()`/`savePartialSession()` both had a defensive fallback that called `store.logActivity()` with real `type`/`completedAt`/`status`/`exercisesCount`/`creditsEarned` regardless of whether a pending entry existed. So the original trust-critical worry doesn't hold: Core Session completions have been logging real data all along, just without the extra optional context fields (`sessionStart`, `energyBefore`, `duration`) that only exist when a session type is routed through `intention.js` — which core-session never was.

**A real bug was found and fixed instead.** Because `core-session.js` re-sets `currentActivityEntry` to its own completion result after every write (needed for `reflect.js`'s "How did that feel?" find-by-id flow), and both functions were spreading `pending` into new writes, **two back-to-back Core Sessions not separated by an `intention.js` visit could share one `activityLog` id** — the second completion's write would inherit the first's stale `id`. `core-session.js` v3 → v4: both functions now build the entry fresh, no `pending` spread, `logActivity()` always assigns a new id.

**Same bug confirmed and fixed in `yoga-session.js` as a same-session follow-up (on request).** Identical spread-pending pattern, and yoga is also reachable directly from `library.js`'s "Yoga / Pilates" card without going through `intention.js`. Fix had to be more surgical than core-session's, since yoga's `pending` *is* sometimes genuine (via `intention.js`): a pending entry carrying a `status` field is stale (every `logActivity()`-written entry has one; `intention.js`'s fresh entry never does), and is now discarded instead of spread — preserving legitimate upstream data when it exists, while still preventing id reuse. `yoga-session.js` v4 → v5.

**Code shipped:** `core-session.js` v3→v4, `yoga-session.js` v4→v5, `sw.js` v181→v183 (two bumps, one per fix, both deployed last). Changelog entries added for both. No schema change.

**Not yet done — logged as open:** on-device confirmation of a real completed Core Session (and ideally the back-to-back-completions scenario for both fixes) — the PM chat has no device access. Worth a quick check next time Graeme's on the phone; the fix is narrow enough that code-trace confidence is high, but "should work" is never the final gate per standing discipline.

**Also logged, not investigated this session:** whether `workout.js` (gym) has the same spread-pending pattern — out of this session's scope, not checked either way.

## ✅ BUILD-4 — Schema Reconciliation: Closed, 30 Jul 2026

Full detail in `alongside_session_handoff_BUILD4_docsreorg_30jul2026_v1.md` (or the handoff pasted into this chat). Summary:

**`schema.md` v1.9** written and pushed to `Documents/Live State/Schema.md`, ground-truthed directly against live `store.js` v10. Supersedes and retires `schema.md` v1.3, `schema_v1_7_15jun2026.md`, `schema_md.docx`, and the v1.5/v1.8 delta notes — **all four should be removed from project knowledge** (Claude can't do this directly; needs Graeme to delete via the UI).

**Two corrections to the 28 Jul reconciliation note itself** — found by checking both read *and* write sides of each field, not inferring from one side alone:
- `todayIntensity` — previously assumed dead. **Actually live**: written by `checkin.js` + `coach-proposal.js`, read by `workoutGenerator.js`.
- `exerciseFeedback` — previously confirmed live (28 Jul pass). **Actually dormant**: `applyFeedbackWeighting()` reads it, but nothing writes it anywhere — no UI collects exercise-level feedback, always falls back to `[]`. This is the same "specified but never built" pattern as empathy transfer — worth remembering as a recurring failure mode, not a one-off.

Also resolved: `stats` isn't a store field at all (computed local var, never persisted — false alarm). `hardBeforeSelections`/`hardBeforeShownAt` confirmed to be the existing `onboarding.*` fields, not a new pair.

**Code shipped:** `workoutGenerator.js` v1.12→v1.13 (removed dead `todaysWorkouts`/`workoutsGeneratedAt` writes and the orphaned `needsRegeneration()`/`getTodaysWorkouts()` pair — confirmed uncalled anywhere). `sw.js` v180→v181, cache bump, deployed last. No behaviour change — dead code, zero live readers.

**Logged, not fixed this session (touch-once):**
- `checkin-mini.js` still writes `workoutsGeneratedAt`, now fully orphaned since its only reader was just removed.
- `activeProgramme.measurementsOptIn` — written via a `mergeWithDefaults()` copy-paste artefact from `strategicGoal.measurementsOptIn`; not part of `activeProgramme`'s own schema.
- `Changelog.md` confirmed stale in both repo and project knowledge (byte-identical, dated 8 Mar 2026). **Decided 30 Jul — resume maintenance.** A new entry for this session's BUILD-4 work has been added to `Documents/Live State/Changelog.md`, re-establishing the practice from here forward. **Full historical backfill for the Mar–Jul 2026 gap is explicitly not part of this decision** — that's a separate, larger job (many versions of `workoutGenerator.js`, `coach-proposal.js`, `sw.js` etc. shipped in that window without a changelog entry) and would need its own scoped session if wanted.

## 📁 Repo Documents Reorganisation — 30 Jul 2026

`alongside-app` repo's `Documents/` folder restructured into four folders, run in the same session as BUILD-4:

- **`Live State/`** — must track live code exactly: `Schema.md` (v1.9), `Changelog.md` (**maintenance resumed 30 Jul** — see BUILD-4 outcome above), `alongside_crisis_safeguarding_policy_23jul2026_v7.docx`.
- **`Admin/`** — `master_schedule.md` is now the **canonical live copy of this document** (see the location-change note at the top of this file). `Admin/Past MS/` holds every superseded version by date. `Admin/Templates/` holds reusable templates. This week's active blueprints/handoffs also live at `Admin/` root — **not yet backfilled with the historical archive** (dozens more exist in project knowledge back to March; a separate future job, not done this session).
- **`Business/`** — company/legal docs kept in the repo since no other copy exists elsewhere: business plan, setup guide, one-pager, portfolio, founding document, pricing model, HMRC status, privacy policy draft, ToS draft, IP/trademark sheet, solicitor letter.
- **`Archive/`** — stale March-2026-era architecture/spec docs and superseded handoffs. Kept, not deleted, matching the existing Cleanup Task List philosophy but for docs instead of code.

**Still needs Graeme:** remove the now-superseded master-schedule versions (v68–v78) and the four retired schema docs from project knowledge — Claude can't delete project knowledge entries directly.

---

## BUILD-5 — full resolution, 24 Jul 2026 (unchanged from v76/v77, retained for reference)

**Fix 1** — `workoutGenerator.js` v1.9→v1.10. `applyDurationCap()` only checked total session length against a fixed per-focus ceiling, never against the user's declared `availableTime`. Added `AVAILABLE_TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES`, capped against `min(focusCap, windowCap)`.

**Fix 2** — `coach-proposal.js` v11→v12. `_getAvailableTime()` read from fields `checkin.js` never actually wrote to, silently fell through to a hardcoded `30`, then wrote that back over the correct value before generation ran. Fixed to read `store.get('availableTime')` directly.

**Fix 3** — `workoutGenerator.js` v1.11→v1.12. With 1 and 2 live, sessions started undershooting instead. `selectExercises()` picked a fixed small exercise count regardless of real per-exercise duration. Fixed with a duration-aware fill loop, bounded by `MAIN_FILL_CEILING`. Verified in a Node simulation, then confirmed on-device: 3 tests, 3 results around 20 min.

**Cache bumps:** `sw.js` v176→v177→v178→v179.

**Residual, logged not fixed:** short-exercise focus types still land under target on average in simulation (~14 min vs a 20-min ask for strength/mobility). Graeme confirmed on-device result as good enough; revisit only if it resurfaces as a real complaint.

---

## B3-2-Test follow-ups — 2 items

1. ~~Duplicate `activityLog` entries~~ — resolved (B3-3).
2. ~~Breathing doesn't route to reflect screen~~ — resolved, confirmed by design.
3. **Check-in feeling-word chip row overflow/wrapping** — still open, untouched. Cosmetic.
4. 🟡 **Reflect textarea sizing/contrast** — code confirmed correct (contrast 11.87:1). Provisionally closed pending one on-device cache-clear confirmation.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Task List — deferred to app sign-off, not actioned now

**Purpose:** things found along the way that are safely inert — not blocking anything, causing no active harm sitting there — worth a final pass once the whole app build is complete, rather than either forgetting them or interrupting a working session to chase something low-stakes. Nothing here gets actioned until Graeme explicitly says "we're at sign-off, let's clear this."

| Item | Found | What it is | Why it can wait |
|------|-------|------------|------------------|
| `js/data/exercises/index.js` | 28 Jul | Orphaned duplicate of `js/data/exercises.js` — identical content, only import paths differ (confirmed via diff). No direct or directory-style imports found anywhere in the codebase, checked twice. | Not imported, causing no active harm. Real risk is future confusion (someone edits the wrong copy), not present danger. Worth removing at sign-off via the GitHub web UI, not urgent today. |

**How to add to this list going forward:** any session that finds something safely inert — old code, superseded docs, an orphaned file, a deprecated pattern nothing depends on — logs it here instead of either fixing it mid-session (scope creep) or letting it quietly vanish. One line: what it is, why it's safe to leave, found-date.

**At sign-off:** work through top to bottom, re-confirm each item is still genuinely inert (don't assume nothing changed since logging), then remove.

## 🔑 Master Schedule → Repo Workflow — decided 30 Jul 2026

Graeme provided the fine-grained GitHub token directly in the PM chat so schedule updates can be pushed straight to the repo, rather than downloaded and uploaded manually via the GitHub web UI each time. From this version forward: the PM chat, at session close, writes the new version, pushes it to `Documents/Admin/master_schedule.md`, moves the previous version into `Documents/Admin/Past MS/`, and removes the superseded copy from project knowledge search results by uploading the new snapshot over it (the old project-knowledge entries themselves still need manual deletion by Graeme — Claude can't do that directly).

**Security note, worth having on record:** this token now lives in the PM chat's own conversation history, not just a build chat's. That's a wider exposure surface than the original "paste into the build chat that needs it" plan — mitigated by the same short expiry (7 days) already in place. Worth revisiting once the product's past the rapid-build phase, same as the original project-knowledge token storage trade-off already logged.

/**
 * sw.js - Alongside Service Worker
 *
 * 19 Jul 2026 v173
 * S4-B3-3 completion session. Deployed together: intention.js v8 (Yoga
 *   branch — selecting Yoga from the self-directed picker now routes to
 *   yoga-session.js's full guided pose-by-pose experience, matching
 *   coach-proposal.js's Door 1 equivalent path, per Graeme's decision
 *   17 Jul); components/reflect.css (new file — .reflect-textarea and
 *   .reflect-chips had no existing CSS anywhere in the repo, confirmed
 *   via GitHub code search, not an override bug — fixes the contrast/
 *   sizing issue confirmed twice on-device); main.css v10 (adds the
 *   reflect.css import). Added reflect.css to SHELL_URLS below.
 *   Two-screens investigation (also this session) produced no code
 *   change — coach-reflection.js is the real daily-use "Today" screen;
 *   intention.js is live but only reached via session-exit "back"/
 *   "home" buttons (e.g. in yoga-session.js) — findings recorded in
 *   the session handoff, not requiring a cache-relevant file change.
 *   Cache bump only for the three files above; no other files changed
 *   this deploy.
 *
 * 14 Jul 2026 v172
 * journal-entry.js v3, checkin-openings.js v2, quiet-session.js v4 —
 *   Session B2 findings, deployed. journal-entry.js/checkin-openings.js:
 *   Journal Privacy Rule fix (Appendix D) — removed signal detection on
 *   journal text (write side) and the journal-content-derived Mode 5
 *   milestone trigger that read it (read side); the latter was live and
 *   firing in production, not dormant. quiet-session.js: added missing
 *   `router` import — onMount()'s back-button handlers were calling
 *   router.navigate() with no import, a live ReferenceError on the only
 *   entry point to mindful movement (via noticing.js). Cache bump only,
 *   so already-installed clients pick up all three corrected files
 *   rather than continuing to serve the pre-fix cached copies.
 *
 * 14 Jul 2026 v171
 * index.html v1 — Sentry error monitoring loader script added to <head>
 *   (Session A, item 1, DSN received and confirmed working end-to-end:
 *   Sentry Issues showed a live "Error | test-3" event, Unhandled,
 *   after a setTimeout-wrapped throw — confirmed on device). Cache
 *   bump only, so already-installed clients pick up the new index.html
 *   rather than continuing to serve the pre-Sentry cached copy.
 *
 * 14 Jul 2026 v170
 * workout.js v4 — closed the workout.js -> activityLog gap (Session A,
 *   items 2 & 3). completeWorkout() now pushes an activityLog entry
 *   (date/completedAt/type:'workout'/durationMins/moodAfter/isEvent/
 *   eventName) alongside its existing workoutHistory write. today.js's
 *   _resolveState() needed this to detect "session-done" — confirmed
 *   working end-to-end on device this session ("You moved today.
 *   That's done." correctly shown after waiting out the 10-minute
 *   proposal-accepted window). No schema change required — the entry
 *   shape already matched store.js v8's documented activityLog fields.
 *   Deploy-verification habit: live GitHub Pages fetch of workout.js/
 *   today.js/sw.js returned binary/unreadable content this session —
 *   fell back to Graeme pasting full file contents per the Ground
 *   Truth Rule's documented fallback. Cache-bump only otherwise; no
 *   other files changed this deploy.
 *
 * (Earlier history — alongside-v130 through v169 — unchanged, see prior
 * versions of this file for full detail.)
 *
 * sw.js must always be the LAST file deployed in any batch.
